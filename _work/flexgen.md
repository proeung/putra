excerpt: "In under six weeks, I spearheaded the development and relaunch of Flexgen.com on Drupal 10+. This project involved creating over 15 custom components/paragraph types, theme variations, forms, product landing pages, and blog posts to effectively showcase Flexgens offerings. Utilizing Vite as the build tool, I implemented Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for an efficient front-end development experience. <a href='https://www.flexgen.com' target='_blank'>visit site</a>"
