excerpt: "In under six weeks, I spearheaded the development and relaunch of Flexgen.com on Drupal 10+. This project involved creating over 15 custom components/paragraph types, theme variations, forms, product landing pages, and blog posts to effectively showcase Flexgens offerings. Utilizing Vite as the build tool, I implemented Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for an efficient front-end development experience. <a href='https://www.flexgen.com' target='_blank'>visit site</a>"

    <h2>FlexGen Calculator - React Widget/App</h2>
    
    <p>This calculator widget marks phase 2 of my work on Flexgen.com. Following the successful launch of their Drupal 10+ site just a couple of months ago, the company identified a need for an interactive tool to demonstrate the financial impact of their energy storage solutions. The challenge was to create a user-friendly, engaging calculator that would:</p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide real-time financial calculations based on user inputs</li>
      <li>Showcase Flexgen's performance compared to competitors</li>
      <li>Serve as a lead generation tool by encouraging newsletter sign-ups</li>
      <li>Seamlessly integrate with the existing Drupal 10+ website</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>Leveraging my expertise in both React and Drupal, I developed a custom React-based calculator widget that integrates smoothly with Flexgen's Drupal 10+ website. The solution included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A React + TypeScript frontend for dynamic, responsive user interactions</li>
      <li>Integration with a Drupal 10+ custom module as Block</li>
      <li>Use of ChartJS for dynamic graph visualizations</li>
      <li>Implementation of Material UI components for a polished look</li>
      <li>A dual-state functionality (locked/unlocked) mode to encourage newsletter sign-ups from potential customers</li>
      <li>Token-based unlocking mechanism for persistent access</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced user engagement through interactive, real-time calculations</li>
      <li>Increased lead generation via newsletter sign-ups</li>
      <li>Improved demo of Flexgen's value proposition to potential clients</li>
      <li>Seamless integration with the existing website, maintaining brand consistency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The project showcases the power of combining modern front-end technologies with Drupal's robust CMS capabilities, resulting in a tool that not only impresses technically but also drives tangible business results.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Completed in approximately a few weeks, from dev to launch, including client feedback and refinements.</p>
