excerpt: "During my time as a senior developer at Bluecadet, I had the honor of spearheading the development of the initial launch of Outrider.org, an exciting partnership with the Outrider Foundation. Together with fellow developer <a href='https://chrisarasin.com' target='_blank'>Chris Arasin</a>, we embarked on a journey to tackle the complex issue of nuclear proliferation through innovative digital solutions. The site boasts interactive timelines, a nuclear blast simulator, and meticulously researched multimedia features, seamlessly integrating galleries of rarely-seen imagery, archival video clips, and unique data visualizations to create a dynamic reading experience."

For this ambitious project, we harnessed the power of [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to construct a search-engine-friendly, performance-driven front end. By adopting the Jamstack approach and seamlessly integrating data from the Drupal CMS, Outrider.org established a new standard for exceptional performance, scalability, and SEO optimization.

A standout feature of Outrider.org is the Bomb Blast nuclear simulator, empowering users to craft custom nuclear visualizations by choosing locations, blast types, and bomb selections to simulate diverse effects. Developed using calculations by historian and scientist [Alex Wellerstein](https://alexwellerstein.com/), of the original [NUKEMAP](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap), the simulator utilizes WebGL canvas to achieve optimal performance in rendering intricate blast effects, injuries, and fatalities. The architecture employs two separate canvas elements: the first for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) mapping and the second, positioned on top, for the blast layer effects.
