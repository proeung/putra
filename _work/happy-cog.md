An interactive visualization of what happens in a nuclear blast, and a flexible system of components for building media-rich longform articles. The Outrider Foundation “envisions a world where people live without fear of nuclear annihilation or climate-induced catastrophe.” To forward this vision, we built a flexible system for creating media-rich longform articles and two custom interactives.
