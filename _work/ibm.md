excerpt: "Over my tenure at Lullabot, I had the privilege of contributing to a groundbreaking project: the transformation of IBM.com. My role evolved from Senior Frontend Developer to Technical Project Manager and eventually Lead Engineer. Although I served as a contractor during this IBM.com engagement, the 4.5 years I spent played a pivotal role in evolving IBM's web experience."

### Transitioning Legacy Systems using Fractal

A defining moment in my journey was leading the transition of IBM's legacy v18 Page Builder and Product pages to the interim "v19a" design systemâ€”a vital step in bridging the gap to the full Carbon design release. This initiative demanded meticulous attention to detail as every page was revisited and revamped, ensuring a smooth transition while preserving IBM's digital identity. Collaborating closely with diverse teams, I navigated the intricacies of this transition, leveraging Fractal, a living component/pattern library developed for the Hybrid Cloud umbrella that houses 41+ modules/patterns. This library served as the backbone of our front-end development of pages populated using Drupal, providing comprehensive documentation and enhancing efficiency.

### Adopting Carbon for IBM.com Design System Storybook

As the Lead Engineer, I helped to integrate the Carbon for IBM.com design system into the new AEM Sites CMS. This transition marked a significant milestone in our digital evolution, achieved through collaboration with the IBM Design Program Office team to build the Storybook library for adoption across different teams within IBM's digital marketing teams. I actively contributed to the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components package and created an exertion library called Carbon for AEM to capture components designed specifically for pages built in AEM. These libraries now serve as the FE building blocks of IBM.com.

### Beyond the Code

Beyond shaping the technical landscape, I engaged with cross-functional teams, including Designers, Digital Strategists, and Product Managers, to prototype, A/B test, and launch custom branded experiences. Notable examples include IBM's "Let's Create" campaign and the marketing landing page for the "Watson Orchestrate" product. My proactive approach fueled our collective success, always seeking process improvements and efficiency enhancements.

### Summary

- Unified Masthead across multiple content ecosystems within IBM.com
- Contributed components to the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components package used and ingested by AEM Sites.
- Updated old Drupal pages (Page Builder and Product) from v18 to v19a as a stop-gap solution to the full release of Carbon for IBM.com
