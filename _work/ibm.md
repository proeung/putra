excerpt: "Over my tenure at Lullabot, I had the privilege of contributing to a groundbreaking project: the transformation of IBM.com. My role evolved from Senior Frontend Developer to Technical Project Manager and eventually Lead Engineer. Although I served as a contractor during this IBM.com engagement, the 4.5 years I spent played a pivotal role in evolving IBM's web experience."

    <h2>Challenges: Transitioning Legacy Systems</h2>

    <p>In late 2018, I joined the IBM Marketing Tech team during a crucial phase: transitioning IBM.com's page experience from the v18 to v19 web standard design system. This project was pivotal in helping various business units craft cutting-edge online experiences. Our objectives were to enhance customer engagement, bolster brand loyalty, streamline operational costs, and harmonize product and web experiences.</p>
    
    <p>Working alongside the Watson team, under the Program Design Office's guidance, we innovated numerous patterns and components. These enhancements transformed content presentation within IBM.com's Drupal ecosystem - the CMS of choice at the time. A central aspect of this initiative was to create a unified repository for all patterns, serving both as a resource for the Drupal theme and as comprehensive documentation. This repository facilitated widespread adoption and enablement across diverse teams.</p>

    <h3>Solution: Fractal Library</h3>

    <p>In my role, I spearheaded the development of a front-end library using Fractal, a dynamic pattern library. Fractal became the repository for front-end code (including Twig, CSS, and JS), which seamlessly integrated with our Drupal templates. This integration ensured that our style guide remained in sync with our production code, overcoming a common challenge in web development. As a result, content creators could easily utilize these new patterns on their product pages. This led to the widespread adoption of the new design system, with 90% of pages incorporating it.</p>
    
    <p>The success of this project set a precedent, influencing the design elements seen in the current <a href='https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/' target='_blank'>Carbon for IBM.com</a> Design System.</p>

    <h3>Challenges: Unified Masthead</h3>

    <p>A consistent interface is crucial for user ease and efficient navigation in any application. Recognizing this, we scrutinized common UI/UX challenges within IBM.com. The masthead, a pivotal navigational element present across all screens, showed functional and content inconsistencies, despite its superficial uniformity.</p>

    <p>To address these disparities and promote a cohesive branding experience, we focused on redesigning the masthead for all applications under the ibm.com/cloud domain. The objectives were clear:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate UI/UX inconsistencies within IBM Cloud’s content ecosystems by developing a unified masthead.</li>
      <li>Ensure the masthead’s adaptability across various publishing platforms (e.g., Drupal, AEM, React).</li>
      <li>Establish a centralized system for content updates and deployment, maintaining visual consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solution: Web Components</h3>

    <p>As the lead UX engineer and primary liaison for stakeholders, I steered the project towards leveraging the Carbon for IBM.com suite. Utilizing Web Components, a cutting-edge web standard, we created framework-agnostic, reusable components. These were encapsulated within HTML tags, facilitating their use across different frameworks. By integrating the Carbon Web Components library, we built upon existing UI components, streamlining the development process.</p>

    <p>After six months of launching the unified Cloud Masthead, it has attracted over 8 million global page loads and 650,000 active monthly users. This success demonstrated the feasibility of accelerating future project development through shared components and deploying content changes uniformly across diverse ecosystems.</p>

    <p>This groundwork was instrumental in developing the global masthead's v2 release, now a standard across ibm.com.

    <h3>Carbon for IBM.com Design System Contribution</h3>

    <p>As the Lead Engineer, I helped to integrate the Carbon for IBM.com design system into the new AEM Sites CMS. This transition marked a significant milestone in our digital evolution, achieved through collaboration with the IBM Design Program Office team to build the Storybook library for adoption across different teams within IBM's digital marketing teams. I actively contributed to the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components package and created an extension library of the Carbon library called 'Carbon for AEM' to capture components designed specifically for pages built in AEM. These libraries now serve as the FE building blocks of IBM.com.</p>

### Beyond the Code

Beyond shaping the technical landscape, I managed a team of talented front-end developers as well as engaged with cross-functional teams, including Design Directors, Digital Strategists, and Product Managers, to prototype, A/B test, and launch custom branded experiences. Notable examples include IBM's "Let's Create" campaign and the marketing landing page for the "Watson Orchestrate" product. My proactive approach fueled our collective success, always seeking process improvements and efficiency enhancements.



### Summary of Role

- Updated old Drupal pages (Page Builder and Product page types) from v18 to v19 using Fractal as a stop-gap solution to the full release of Carbon for IBM.com Library.
- Contributed components to the Carbon for IBM.com Web Components and React packages used and ingested by AEM Sites, the content publishing tool for the marketing site.
- Created an extension library of Carbon called "Carbon for AEM" to manage new branding expressions and components that are intended for experimental usage within the IBM.com AEM Sites.
- Helped unified Masthead across multiple content ecosystems within IBM.com.
