          When I'm not immersed in code, I indulge my love for gardening, sharing my passion on Instagram and TikTok (@goodpathgarden). In addition, my competitive spirit shines as I co-founded and manage a fantasy league app dedicated to the hit reality show "Big Brother" alongside my husband, aptly named FantasyBB.
